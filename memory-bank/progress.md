## Known Issues

1. **UI Alignment** - We had issues with the alignment between header and sidebar that have been resolved by matching heights and border styles
2. **Sidebar Toggle Button** - The toggle button position needed adjustment to make it properly visible
3. **Dashboard Content Spacing** - Working on proper spacing between the sidebar and dashboard content
4. **Responsive Behavior** - Mobile navigation required special handling for sidebar toggling
5. **Component Import Issues** - We encountered issues with default vs. named exports in some components which required fixes
6. **Missing Type Definitions** - Had to create proper TypeScript interfaces for Users, Subjects, and Classes
7. **Fixed Dark Theme Issues** - Resolved text selection visibility, improved card contrast, enhanced table selection styling
8. **Theme Property Access** - Fixed issues with accessing non-existent theme properties (replaced `theme.colors.error` with `theme.colors.danger[500]`)
9. **Unused Variables** - Addressed linter warnings about unused variables by prefixing them with underscores or removing them
10. **Missing Prop Interfaces** - Added interfaces for styled component props to resolve TypeScript errors
11. **Import Conflicts** - Resolved conflicts between imported types and local declarations
12. **TypeScript Linter Errors** - Fixed multiple linter errors throughout the codebase:

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Planning Phase
- **Decision**: Use React with TypeScript for frontend development
  - **Reasoning**: Type safety, better developer experience, and maintainability
  
- **Decision**: Use Vite as the build tool
  - **Reasoning**: Faster development experience, better HMR, and optimized builds

- **Decision**: Use styled-components for styling
  - **Reasoning**: Component-scoped styles, theming support, and dynamic styling capabilities
  
- **Decision**: Use Framer Motion for animations
  - **Reasoning**: Declarative API, better performance, and easier animation sequencing

### Frontend Implementation Phase
- **Decision**: Implement collapsible sidebar
  - **Reasoning**: Better space utilization on smaller screens while providing full navigation on larger displays
  
- **Decision**: Use Feather icons from react-icons
  - **Reasoning**: Clean, consistent icon set that matches the modern UI design
  
- **Decision**: Different mobile vs desktop navigation
  - **Reasoning**: Better usability on touch devices and small screens

- **Decision**: Different UI designs for different admin pages
  - **Reasoning**: Each section has unique requirements - Users and Subjects benefit from table layouts, while Classes benefit from a more visual card-based approach

- **Decision**: Implement view mode toggles for Classes page
  - **Reasoning**: Provides flexibility for users to view data in their preferred format (grid or list)

- **Decision**: Modal-based interfaces for Role and Permission management
  - **Reasoning**: Provides focused context for complex operations while maintaining the main page structure

- **Decision**: Implement a theme context for application-wide settings
  - **Reasoning**: Enables theme control from the Settings page and consistent theme application across components

- **Decision**: Enhanced dark theme implementation
  - **Reasoning**: Ensures all components have proper contrast and visibility in dark mode, improving accessibility and user experience

- **Decision**: Use localStorage for authentication persistence
  - **Reasoning**: Provides a simple way to maintain user sessions without a backend, can be replaced with proper JWT tokens later

- **Decision**: Implement profile page with tabbed interface
  - **Reasoning**: Organizes different aspects of profile management (general info, security) into logical sections

- **Decision**: Implement TeacherStudents page with comprehensive management features
  - **Reasoning**: Provides teachers with a detailed view of student information, performance metrics, and course assignments in a single interface
  - **Features**: Status filtering, course filtering, visual performance indicators, and quick action buttons

- **Decision**: Implement TeacherSchedule page with weekly calendar view
  - **Reasoning**: Gives teachers an intuitive visual representation of their teaching schedule with filtering capabilities and detailed class information

- **Decision**: Implement consistent TypeScript practices
  - **Reasoning**: Establishes code quality standards, improves maintainability, and prevents common errors
  - **Features**: Prop interfaces, theme property access patterns, naming conventions for unused variables

## Next Development Steps

1. Implement form validation for profile updates and password changes
2. Enhance Permission system UI building on the Role management foundation
3. Implement User creation workflows with role assignment
4. Connect UI components to data sources
5. Add confirmation dialogs for critical actions
6. Implement user preference persistence for theme settings
7. Continue Teacher panel development with Dashboard implementation
8. Implement additional Teacher panel pages (curriculum management, materials, tests)
