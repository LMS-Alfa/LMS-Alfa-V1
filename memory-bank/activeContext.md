# LMS Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are making significant progress on the Admin Panel UI components. Our current focus is on:

1. Completing the Timetable management interface with calendar functionality
2. Developing dashboard content with statistics and overview panels
3. Creating a comprehensive Settings page for system configuration
4. Enhancing the permission system UI to build on our Role management implementation
5. Implementing proper form validation and confirmation dialogs

## Recent Changes

- Created the Users management page with table-based interface and search/filter functionality
- Implemented the Subjects management page with similar table structure but different visual elements
- Developed the Classes management page with an innovative card-based grid layout and list view toggle
- Implemented the Role management page with permission assignment functionality
- Added the Roles link to the Sidebar navigation
- Developed reusable components for role and permission management
- Fixed import issues between components (default vs. named exports)
- Created TypeScript interfaces for data models (User, Subject, Class, Role, Permission)
- Improved UI interactions with animations and transitions
- Implemented responsive layouts for all new pages

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Complete the Timetables management interface with weekly schedule view
2. Develop dashboard content with key statistics and metrics
3. Create the Settings page for system configuration
4. Implement user creation workflows with role assignment
5. Enhance the Permission system UI with more granular controls
6. Add confirmation dialogs for critical actions

### Short-term Goals
1. Implement authentication system and login flows
2. Connect UI components to data sources
3. Add form validation for data entry
4. Create confirmation dialogs for critical actions
5. Implement error handling for API requests

### Medium-term Goals
1. Develop the Teacher Panel layout and components
2. Implement the Student Panel with basic functionality
3. Create the communication channels between panels
4. Integrate file upload/download functionality
5. Build testing infrastructure

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Component Design Approaches
- **Table-based Design**: For data-heavy screens like Users, Subjects, and Roles management
- **Card-based Design**: For more visual content like Classes management
- **View Toggles**: Allowing users to switch between grid and list views for flexibility
- **Consistent Patterns**: Using shared UI components while adapting to each page's needs
- **Modal-based Forms**: Using modal dialogs for focused data entry experiences

### UI Design Philosophy
- Different admin sections have unique requirements that benefit from tailored interfaces
- Maintaining consistent theme and design system across different UI approaches
- Providing familiar patterns (tables, cards) while enhancing with modern interactions
- Balancing information density with visual appeal
- Grouping related functionality (e.g., roles and permissions) for better user experience

### Implementation Approach
- **Component Structure**: Modular components organized by panel and functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **State Management**: React hooks for component state, context for shared state
- **Data Models**: TypeScript interfaces for consistent data structure
- **Reusable Modal Components**: Creating generic, reusable modal components for forms and detail views

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### UI Component Patterns
- **Table Pattern**: For displaying structured data with sorting and filtering
- **Card Grid Pattern**: For visual representation of data items with clear hierarchy
- **View Switching Pattern**: Toggle between different data visualization modes
- **Action Menu Pattern**: Contextual menus for item-specific actions
- **Modal Form Pattern**: Focused data entry in overlay dialogs
- **Grouped Permission Pattern**: Organizing permissions by category for better usability

### Code Organization
- Components are organized by panel (admin, teacher, student)
- Page components in pages directory with proper subdirectories
- Shared UI components in common directories
- TypeScript interfaces in types directory
- Modal components structured for reusability across the application

### Styling Approach
- Styled-components with theme provider
- Consistent color variables for different UI states
- Responsive utilities through media queries
- Animation handling through Framer Motion
- Color coding for status indicators and categories
- Visual hierarchy through spacing and typography

## Learnings and Project Insights

### UI Development
- Different UI approaches work better for different data types
- Card-based layouts provide better visual scanning for fewer, more complex items
- Table-based layouts excel for scanning many items with similar attributes
- View mode toggles provide flexibility for users with different preferences
- Pagination is essential for performance with large datasets
- Modal forms provide a focused context for data entry and editing

### Component Design
- Proper TypeScript interfaces improve development experience
- Export/import patterns matter (default vs. named exports)
- Reusing styled components across pages improves consistency
- Animated transitions improve perceived performance and user experience
- Consistent action patterns (edit, delete, filter) make the interface more intuitive
- Breaking down complex interfaces (like permissions management) into smaller components improves maintainability

### Responsive Considerations
- Card layouts require different grid adjustments than tables
- Mobile views often need simplified data display
- Search and filter controls need adaptation for smaller screens
- Touch targets should be appropriately sized on mobile
- Consider collapsing less important data on smaller screens 
- Modal dialogs require special handling on mobile devices
