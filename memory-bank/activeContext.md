### Code Organization
- Components are organized by panel (admin, teacher, student)
- Page components in pages directory with proper subdirectories
- Shared UI components in common directories
- TypeScript interfaces in types directory
- Modal components structured for reusability across the application
- Theme-related code centralized in theme.ts and accessed via context
- Auth-related code centralized in AuthContext with reusable hooks

### Styling Approach
- Styled-components with theme provider
- Consistent color variables for different UI states
- Responsive utilities through media queries
- Animation handling through Framer Motion
- Color coding for status indicators and categories
- Visual hierarchy through spacing and typography
- Theme-aware styling using props from ThemeProvider

### TypeScript Practices
- **Parameter Naming**: Unused parameters should be prefixed with underscore (e.g., `_variable`)
- **Interface Definitions**: Each styled component with props should have a dedicated interface
- **Theme Access**: Use the correct theme property paths (`theme.colors.danger[500]` instead of `theme.colors.error`)
- **Partial Types**: Use `Partial<Type>` for optional parameters in functions
- **Import Aliases**: Use import aliases to resolve naming conflicts (`import { User as UserType } from '../../types/User'`)
